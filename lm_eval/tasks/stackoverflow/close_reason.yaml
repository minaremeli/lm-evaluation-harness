description: "Classify the close reason of the presented question. The close reason can be either 'Off-topic', 'Opinion-based', 'Needs more focus' or 'Needs detail or clarity'. Close reason definitions:\nOff-topic: Everything that is not a specific programming problem, a software algorithm or tool commonly used by programmers or a practical answerable problem that is unique to software development.\nOpinion-based: This question is likely to be answered with opinions rather than facts and citations. It should be updated so it will lead to fact-based answers.\nNeeds more focus: This question currently includes multiple questions in one. It should focus on one problem only.\nNeeds details or clarity: This question should include more details and clarify the problem."
